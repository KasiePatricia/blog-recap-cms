One question you might want to ask if you are new to email copywriting is: how do I write an email subject line that is difficult to ignore? Crafting the perfect email subject line is an art as well as a science.

In a world where inboxes are flooded with emails, standing out requires a strategic approach. Your email subject line is your first and perhaps only chance to make a lasting impression.

Before you can begin to measure your click rate or conversion rate, one important element you must pay attention to is your subject line. As short as it is, it can be quite hard to craft and if it fails to catch your recipients’ attention, nothing else matters.

Read on to find out how to write irresistible email subject lines that will not only capture your audience’s attention but also boost your open rates.

# Why Email Subject Lines Matter

The subject line is the gateway to your email content. According to various studies, 47% of email recipients open emails based solely on the subject line, while 69% report emails as spam based on the subject line alone. This means that a compelling subject line can significantly influence your email marketing success.

**How can you recognize a good subject line?**

* It is personalized
* It is short and concise
* It does not include spammy words
* It asks questions
* It uses action words
* It creates urgency
* It offers value
* It is tested and optimized

**Personalize it**

Personalization can significantly increase open rates. Including the recipient’s name or other personalized information about their needs,interests or behaviour makes the email feel more tailored and relevant. For example, “John, have you claimed your 20% discount yet?” feels more personal and engaging than a generic subject line.

Also, do not make the mistake of sending your emails with the company’s email address. Use a customized email domain address or a personal email address such as “Ebuka from Circle”

**Keep it short**

With many people reading emails on mobile devices, keeping your subject lines concise is essential. Aim for 6–10 words or about 30–50 characters to avoid some parts being cut off by the email service providers. This ensures your subject line is fully visible on most screens. For example, “Act Now: Flash Sale Ends Tonight!” is both concise and compelling rather than “Setting up catchy emails to prevent missed opportunities in your email marketing campaigns: how our feature can help.”

**Avoid spammy words**

One of the fastest ways to disrupt your email marketing campaign is the use of spammy words in your subject line. Certain words can trigger spam filters, reducing the chances of your email reaching the inbox. Avoid using all caps, excessive exclamation points, and words like “free,” “buy,” or “guarantee.” Instead, focus on being clear and genuine. Ignore the temptation to use clickbaits by exaggerating your offer, you will be tampering with your sender reputation.

**Ask questions**

A more engaging format you might want to try in your next email campaign is to ask questions. Opening with a question in your subject line can instantly engage your audience. Questions provoke thought and curiosity, making recipients more likely to open your email to find the answer. For instance, “Are you addressing these common SEO mistakes?” or “Can I make your life 30% easier?” are questions that invite the reader to explore further.

**Use action words**

Using verbs that prompt action or convey a sense of engagement to encourage email recipients to open, read, or respond to the email. These words should be emotionally charged and persuasive, designed to trigger a response from the reader. Words such as “exclusive,” “limited-time,” “urgent,” can generate excitement and a sense of urgency. A subject line like “Exclusive Deal Just for You: 50% Off Today!” is likely to catch the reader’s eye and prompt them to open the email.

**Create urgency**

Creating urgency in your email subject lines is an effective strategy to prompt immediate action from your recipients. You can do this by using time-sensitive phrases such as “limited time,” “last chance,” “today only,” or “expires soon” to signal to recipients that they need to act quickly. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a powerful motivator that will suggest to readers not to miss an opportunity.

**Offer value**

Value-driven subject lines communicate the benefit or importance of opening the email, making it clear to the recipient that there’s something valuable inside. Your subject line should provide a solution to your recipient’s pain point. It should be something they have always wanted. The value you are offering can be in clearly communicating the product benefit, providing valuable insights, piquing reader’s curiosity, offering free resources or exclusive deals.

**Test and optimize**

A/B testing different subject lines is crucial for finding what works best with your audience. Experiment with various lengths, tones, and keywords to see which subject lines yield the highest open rates. Use the data to refine your strategy continually.

## Conclusion

Writing irresistible email subject lines that boost open rates is about understanding your audience, being concise, and using persuasive language. By incorporating personalization, offering value and curiosity, you can create subject lines that not only capture attention but also drive engagement. Remember to test and refine your approach to continually improve your results.
